# Getting Started

If you want to forego the tutorial and just try these applications out:

1. [Setup a Python virtual environment](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/common-python-tools-using-virtualenv-installing-with-pip-and-managing-packages#a-thorough-virtualenv-how-to) with Python 3.6.

2. Start by installing [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org).

3. Install all Python dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. To use the emotion dog filter, navigate into `src`:

```
cd src
```

5. Launch the final script.

```
python step_8_dog_emotion_mask.py
```
